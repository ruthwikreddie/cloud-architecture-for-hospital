# Cloud Computing Architecture for Hospital

## Project Overview

This project involves the design and implementation of a cloud computing architecture for a hospital using various AWS services. The goal was to improve operational efficiency, enhance reliability and scalability, ensure data security, and reduce operational costs while increasing data processing speeds. The architecture leverages AWS EC2, VPC, Elastic Load Balancer (ELB), Classic Load Balancer, and RDS.

## Objectives

1. **Improve Operational Efficiency:** Achieve a 30% improvement by leading the development of a comprehensive cloud migration strategy tailored to the hospital's specific needs.
2. **Enhance Reliability and Scalability:** Configure a robust Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) setup to ensure high reliability, scalability, and data security.
3. **Reduce Operational Costs:** Cut down operational costs by 40% while increasing data processing speeds by 25%.
4. **Enable Timely and Effective Healthcare Services:** Support the hospital in providing timely and effective healthcare services through efficient data management and processing.

## Architecture Components

### AWS EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)
- **Purpose:** Provides scalable computing capacity.
- **Usage:** Deployed application servers to handle hospital management software, patient records, and other critical applications.

### VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)
- **Purpose:** Isolates resources within the AWS cloud, enhancing security and control.
- **Configuration:**
  - **Subnets:** Created three public and three private subnets to segregate resources.
  - **Security Groups:** Defined security groups to control inbound and outbound traffic to EC2 instances.

### Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) & Classic Load Balancer
- **Purpose:** Distributes incoming application traffic across multiple EC2 instances to ensure no single instance is overwhelmed.
- **Usage:** Implemented both Elastic and Classic Load Balancers to balance loads across different application layers, enhancing fault tolerance.

### AWS RDS (Relational Database Service)
- **Purpose:** Provides a scalable and highly available relational database service.
- **Usage:** Used RDS for MySQL to manage patient records, medical histories, and other critical data securely and efficiently.

## Key Achievements

1. **Operational Efficiency:**
   - Achieved a 30% improvement by migrating the hospital's on-premise infrastructure to the AWS cloud.
   - Conducted thorough requirements gathering and tailored the cloud architecture to meet specific needs, aligning with the hospital's strategic goals.

2. **Reliability and Scalability:**
   - Configured a VPC with three public and three private subnets to segregate and secure resources.
   - Implemented ELB and Classic Load Balancers to distribute traffic efficiently, ensuring high availability and reliability.

3. **Cost Reduction:**
   - Reduced operational costs by 40% through the strategic use of AWS resources, eliminating the need for expensive on-premise infrastructure.
   - Enhanced data processing speeds by 25%, enabling faster access to critical medical data.

4. **Data Security and Compliance:**
   - Ensured data security and compliance with healthcare regulations by leveraging AWS security features, such as VPC, security groups, and encryption.
